# Neural Style Transfer in Audio & Music

- **Project type**: Weak computational creativity (focus is on generating valuable artefacts)
- **Focus**: Style transfer between audio data (music as content, audio or music as style)

With respect to the style transfer...

- **Content**: Melodies, pieces, songs
    - Preferably with clear voices and tones (to enable easier evaluation of retained musicality)
    - Content must remain relatively unchanged w.r.t. melody and harmony
- **Style**: Ambience, ambient music, sound textures
