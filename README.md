# Computational creativity
## Conceptual map

**CONSIDER AS YOU GO**: Fundamental differences between human and computational creativity.

- Paradigms in AI
    - Problem solving
    - Artefact generation (main paradigm in computational creativity)
    - **CONSIDER**: _How thinking of AI as more than a problem-solving tool extends AI's potential?_
- Generative technology
    - Data-driven
    - Rule-based
 - Thinking generatively
    - Output vs. generation
    - Generative software <br> _Technically, all software is generative, but "generative software has a special meaning_
    - Artefact spaces <br> _A "space" is similar to the idea of a "sample space" of a random process_
        - Generative spaces
        - Possibility spaces
    - **CONSIDER**: _Generative vs. creative_
  
**NOTE: Generative system**: A generative system is a process which has unpredictable outputs affected by randomness shaped by procedures. A generative software is a kind of generative system; herein lies the difference between software as such (which is technically generative, in the sense of generating outputs) and "generative software".

**NOTE: Generative space and possibility space (and its purpose)**: <br> A generative space is the set of artefacts that a particular generative system can currently produce. A possibility space is a set of artefacts meeting a particular definition; they define a broader class or "genus" to which the generative spaces of existing or potential generative spaces belong. The purpose of defining a possibility space is to help compare, plan and hypothesise about generative systems.
